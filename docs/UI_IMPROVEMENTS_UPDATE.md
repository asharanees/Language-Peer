# UI Improvements Update

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ **Signin Form Updated**
- **Login**: Now uses **Username + Password** (instead of email + password)
- **Signup**: Still uses **Email + Password** (for account creation)
- **Backend**: Converts username to email format for demo purposes

### 2. ✅ **Progress Page Content**
The Progress page already shows meaningful content including:
- **Overall Progress**: 68% completion with visual indicators
- **Weekly Goals**: Session tracking (3 of 5 sessions this week)
- **Skill Breakdown**: Grammar (75%), Pronunciation (82%), Vocabulary (68%), Fluency (71%)
- **Recent Sessions**: List of past practice sessions with agents
- **Achievements**: Unlocked and locked achievement badges
- **Statistics**: Total hours, current streak, session count

### 3. ✅ **Profile Button Removed**
- Removed "Profile" from main navigation menu
- Removed profile route from App.tsx
- Removed profile link from Footer
- Profile page still exists but is not accessible through navigation

### 4. ✅ **Login Button Fixed**
- Changed Login button from `variant="ghost"` to `variant="outline"`
- Login button now appears more prominent and clickable
- No longer appears muted/faded next to the Sign Up button

### 5. ✅ **Homepage Navigation Simplified**
- **Removed "Watch Demo" button** for non-authenticated users to reduce decision paralysis
- **Single clear CTA**: "Get Started Free" button now directly routes to `/conversation`
- **Consistent flow**: Both authenticated ("Start Practicing") and non-authenticated users have direct access to conversation practice
- **Improved conversion**: Eliminated potential drop-off points in user journey

### 6. ✅ **Authentication Modal Z-Index Fixed**
- **Increased z-index** from 1000 to 9999 for the authentication modal overlay
- **Ensures proper layering**: Modal now appears above all other UI elements
- **Prevents UI conflicts**: Resolves potential issues with other high z-index components
- **Better user experience**: Modal is always visible and accessible when triggered

## Updated Authentication Flow

### Login Process
1. User enters **Username** (not email)
2. User enters **Password**
3. System converts username to email format for demo storage
4. User is logged in and sees greeting with username

### Signup Process
1. User enters **Email** (for account creation)
2. User enters **Password**
3. Account is created with email as identifier

## UI Components Updated

### AuthModal.tsx & AuthModal.css
- Dynamic form fields based on mode (login vs signup)
- Login shows "Username" field
- Signup shows "Email" field
- Proper form validation and placeholders
- **Z-index increased to 9999** to ensure modal appears above all other elements

### Header.tsx
- Removed Profile from navigation array
- Changed Login button variant from "ghost" to "outline"
- User greeting shows username part of email

### HomePage.tsx
- Simplified call-to-action buttons for better user experience
- Removed secondary "Watch Demo" button to reduce cognitive load
- Both authenticated and non-authenticated users now have direct path to conversation practice
- "Get Started Free" button routes directly to `/conversation` page

### App.tsx & Footer.tsx
- Removed profile route and links
- Clean navigation without profile access

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Login button is now clearly visible and clickable

3. **Flexible Auth**: Username for login, email for signup
4. **Rich Progress**: Users can see meaningful learning statistics
