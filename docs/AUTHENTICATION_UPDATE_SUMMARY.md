# Authentication Feature Documentation Update Summary

## Recent Changes (Latest Update)

**Date**: Current
**Change**: AuthModal component simplified to minimal authentication form

**What Changed**:
- Removed `name` field from registration form
- Removed `targetLanguage` selection dropdown
- Removed `nativeLanguage` selection dropdown  
- Removed `currentLevel` proficiency selection
- Form now only collects `email` and `password`
