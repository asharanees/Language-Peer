# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LanguagePeer is a voice-first GenAI application designed to help language learners build fluency and confidence through natural conversations with modular AI agents. The application addresses the common challenges language learners face: finding consistent speaking partners, overcoming speaking anxiety, and receiving meaningful feedback on their spoken language skills. By providing a safe, judgment-free environment for voice-based practice with intelligent AI agents, LanguagePeer empowers users to improve their speaking abilities through personalized conversations and actionable feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to engage in voice-based conversations with AI agents on topics I'm interested in, so that I can practice speaking in a natural and engaging way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation session THEN the system SHALL initiate voice-based dialogue with an AI agent

3. WHEN a user speaks during a conversation THEN the system SHALL process their voice input in real-time
4. WHEN a conversation is active THEN the system SHALL maintain natural dialogue flow with appropriate responses
5. IF a user pauses for more than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide gentle prompts to continue the conversation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to receive real-time feedback on my grammar, fluency, and vocabulary usage, so that I can identify areas for improvement during practice sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a speaking turn THEN the system SHALL analyze their grammar accuracy
2. WHEN a user speaks THEN the system SHALL evaluate their fluency and pronunciation
3. WHEN vocabulary usage is detected THEN the system SHALL assess appropriateness and complexity level
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide constructive feedback within 3 seconds
5. IF errors are identified THEN the system SHALL suggest specific improvements and alternative expressions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to track my progress over time and receive personalized session recommendations, so that I can see my improvement and focus on areas that need work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a conversation session ends THEN the system SHALL record performance metrics and progress data
2. WHEN a user accesses their profile THEN the system SHALL display progress tracking with visual indicators
3. WHEN sufficient data is available THEN the system SHALL identify strengths and areas for improvement
4. WHEN a user starts a new session THEN the system SHALL recommend topics and difficulty levels based on their history
5. IF progress milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL provide encouraging feedback and unlock new features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to practice in a safe, judgment-free environment, so that I can build confidence without fear of embarrassment or criticism.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes speaking errors THEN the system SHALL provide supportive and encouraging feedback
2. WHEN feedback is delivered THEN the system SHALL focus on improvement rather than criticism

5. IF a user expresses frustration THEN the system SHALL provide motivational support and adjust difficulty accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want to customize my learning experience with different AI agent personalities and conversation styles, so that I can practice with varied speaking partners and scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses agent selection THEN the system SHALL display multiple AI agent personalities with distinct characteristics
2. WHEN a user selects an AI agent THEN the system SHALL adapt conversation style to match the chosen personality
3. WHEN different scenarios are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to practice various conversation contexts
4. WHEN agent interactions occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent personality traits throughout the session
5. IF users want variety THEN the system SHALL recommend different agents and scenarios to diversify practice

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a language learner, I want the application to work seamlessly with voice input and output, so that I can focus on speaking practice without technical distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize voice recognition and synthesis capabilities
2. WHEN a user speaks THEN the system SHALL accurately transcribe their speech with minimal latency
3. WHEN the AI responds THEN the system SHALL generate natural-sounding speech output
