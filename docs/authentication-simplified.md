# Authentication System - Simplified

## Current Status

LanguagePeer now uses a **simplified authentication system** with minimal user data collection.

## Authentication Method

- **Current**: Mock/Demo authentication (localStorage-based)
- **Future**: Can be upgraded to AWS Cognito or custom backend authentication

## User Data Collected

### Signup Form
- ✅ **Username** (unique identifier)
- ✅ **Password** (minimum 6 characters)

### Removed Fields (Simplified Authentication)
- ❌ Full Name
- ❌ Target Language
- ❌ Native Language  
- ❌ Current Level

**Note**: The AuthModal component has been updated to only collect essential authentication data (username and password). All language preference and profile fields have been removed from the initial signup flow to minimize friction and focus on core functionality.

## User Interface

### Simplified User Object
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  username: string;
}
```

### Profile Page
- Shows username
- Displays avatar with first letter of username
- Shows message about future profile features
- Provides sign out functionality

### Header
- Shows greeting with username
- Example: "myusername" displays as "Hi, myusername"

## Implementation Details

### Components Updated
- `AuthModal.tsx` - **Recently Updated**: Further simplified signup form to only collect email and password
- `AuthContext.tsx` - Simplified user interface
- `ProfilePage.tsx` - Minimal profile display
- `Header.tsx` - Username-based greeting

### Latest Changes (AuthModal.tsx)
The AuthModal component form data has been streamlined to:
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
  username: '',
  password: ''
});
```

Removed fields from the form state:
- `name` - User's full name
- `targetLanguage` - Language to learn
- `nativeLanguage` - User's native language  
- `currentLevel` - Current proficiency level

### Authentication Flow
1. **Signup**: Username + Password → Creates user with ID and username
2. **Login**: Username + Password → Retrieves user data
3. **Session**: Stored in localStorage (demo only)
4. **Logout**: Clears localStorage and user state

## Future Enhancements

When ready to implement real authentication:

1. **AWS Cognito Integration**
   - Replace mock authentication with Cognito User Pools
   - Add email verification
   - Implement password reset functionality

2. **Extended Profile**
   - Add language preferences during onboarding
   - Collect learning goals and current level
   - Store progress and statistics

3. **Security Improvements**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Secure session management
   - API authentication middleware

## Benefits of Simplified Approach

- **Faster Development**: Focus on core language learning features
- **Better UX**: Minimal friction during signup
- **Privacy Friendly**: Collect only essential information
- **Easy Migration**: Can upgrade to full authentication later

## Current Limitations

- No password reset functionality
- No username uniqueness validation across sessions
- Session data stored in localStorage (not secure)
- No real backend authentication

This simplified approach allows rapid development and testing while maintaining the ability to upgrade to a full authentication system when needed.
