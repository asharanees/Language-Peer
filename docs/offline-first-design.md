# LanguagePeer Offline-First Design 🔄

## 🎯 Overview

LanguagePeer is designed with an **offline-first approach** to ensure uninterrupted language learning experiences. The application can function fully without backend API connectivity, providing local session management and mock agent responses.

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### 1. Local Session Management
- **Session ID Generation**: Creates unique session IDs locally using timestamp and random strings
- **No API Dependency**: Conversations start immediately without waiting for backend responses
- **Browser Storage**: Maintains conversation state in browser local storage

### 2. Mock Agent Responses
- **Personality-Based Responses**: Each agent personality has predefined response patterns
- **Contextual Awareness**: Mock responses adapt to conversation topics and user input
- **Seamless Experience**: Users cannot distinguish between mock and API responses

### 3. Graceful API Integration
- **Progressive Enhancement**: API responses enhance the experience when available
- **Transparent Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to mock responses when API fails
- **State Synchronization**: Seamless transition between offline and online modes

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Session Management

```typescript
// Local session ID generation
const generateLocalSessionId = (): string => {
  const timestamp = Date.now();
  const randomId = Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);
  return `session-${timestamp}-${randomId}`;
};

// Example: session-1642694400000-abc123def
```

### Enhanced Mock Agent Response System

```typescript
const generateEnhancedOfflineResponse = (userInput: string, agent: Agent, history: ConversationMessage[]): string => {
  const input = userInput.toLowerCase();
  
  // Context-aware responses based on user input and conversation history
  const contextualResponses = {
    'friendly-tutor': {

        "I notice your rhythm is improving! English has a specific stress pattern. Let's work on emphasizing the right syllables.",
        "Excellent progress on your intonation! Now let's focus on the natural flow and rhythm of English speech."
      ],
      default: [
        "Your pronunciation is coming along nicely! Let's continue working on clarity and natural speech patterns.",
        "I can hear improvement in your speech! Let's focus on some specific sounds that will make you even clearer."
      ]
    }
  };

  const agentResponses = contextualResponses[agent.personality];

  const responses = (agentResponses as any)[category] || (agentResponses as any).default;
  return responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)];
};

// Enhanced feedback generation
const generateMockFeedback = (transcript: string): LanguageFeedback => {

```

### Conversation State Management

```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  sessionId: string;
  messages: ConversationMessage[];
  agent: Agent;
  startTime: Date;
  isConnected: boolean;
}

// Store in browser local storage
const saveConversationState = (state: ConversationState) => {
  localStorage.setItem(`conversation-${state.sessionId}`, JSON.stringify(state));
};
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Local Storage Strategy
```typescript
// Conversation persistence
interface StoredConversation {
  sessionId: string;
  messages: ConversationMessage[];
  agent: Agent;
  startTime: string;
  lastActivity: string;
}

// Storage management
class ConversationStorage {
  private static readonly STORAGE_KEY = 'languagepeer-conversations';
  
  static save(conversation: StoredConversation): void {
    const conversations = this.getAll();
    conversations[conversation.sessionId] = conversation;
    localStorage.setItem(this.STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(conversations));
  }
  
  static load(sessionId: string): StoredConversation | null {
    const conversations = this.getAll();
    return conversations[sessionId] || null;
  }
  
  static getAll(): Record<string, StoredConversation> {
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(this.STORAGE_KEY);
    return stored ? JSON.parse(stored) : {};
  }
}
```

### Mock Response Engine
```typescript
class MockResponseEngine {
  private responsePatterns: Record<string, string[]>;
  private contextualResponses: Record<string, string[]>;
  
  generateResponse(userInput: string, agent: Agent, context: ConversationContext): string {
    // Analyze user input for context
    const inputAnalysis = this.analyzeInput(userInput);
    
    // Select appropriate response pattern
    const responsePattern = this.selectPattern(agent.personality, inputAnalysis);
    
    // Generate contextual response
    return this.generateContextualResponse(responsePattern, context);
  }
  
  private analyzeInput(input: string): InputAnalysis {
    return {
      topic: this.detectTopic(input),
      sentiment: this.detectSentiment(input),
      complexity: this.assessComplexity(input),
      errors: this.detectErrors(input)
    };
  }
}
```

### Text-to-Speech Engine
```typescript
class OfflineTTSEngine {
  private voiceMap: Record<string, SpeechSynthesisVoice | null> = {};
  
  constructor() {
    this.initializeVoices();
  }
  
  speakText(text: string, agentPersonality: string): void {
    if (!('speechSynthesis' in window)) {
      console.warn('Speech synthesis not supported');
      return;
    }
    
    // Cancel any ongoing speech
    window.speechSynthesis.cancel();
    
    const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);
    
    // Configure voice based on agent personality
    this.configureVoiceForAgent(utterance, agentPersonality);
    
    // Set up event handlers
    utterance.onstart = () => this.onSpeechStart();
    utterance.onend = () => this.onSpeechEnd();
    utterance.onerror = () => this.onSpeechError();
    
    window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
  }
  
  private configureVoiceForAgent(utterance: SpeechSynthesisUtterance, personality: string): void {
    const voices = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices();
    
    switch (personality) {
      case 'friendly-tutor':
        utterance.voice = this.findBestVoice(voices, ['female', 'samantha', 'karen']);
        utterance.pitch = 1.1;
        utterance.rate = 0.9;
        break;
        
      case 'strict-teacher':
        utterance.voice = this.findBestVoice(voices, ['male', 'daniel', 'alex']);
        utterance.pitch = 0.9;
        utterance.rate = 0.8;
        break;

        utterance.pitch = 1.0;
        utterance.rate = 1.0;
        break;
        
      case 'pronunciation-coach':
        utterance.voice = this.findBestVoice(voices, ['english', 'us', 'american']);
        utterance.pitch = 1.0;
        utterance.rate = 0.85;
        break;
    }
    
    utterance.volume = 0.8;
    utterance.lang = 'en-US';
  }
  
  private findBestVoice(voices: SpeechSynthesisVoice[], preferences: string[]): SpeechSynthesisVoice | null {
    for (const preference of preferences) {
      const voice = voices.find(v => v.name.toLowerCase().includes(preference));
      if (voice) return voice;
    }
    
    // Fallback to first English voice
    return voices.find(v => v.lang.startsWith('en')) || null;
  }
  
  stopSpeaking(): void {
    window.speechSynthesis.cancel();
  }
}
```

### Connection Management
```typescript
class ConnectionManager {
  private isOnline: boolean = navigator.onLine;
  private apiAvailable: boolean = false;
  
  constructor() {
    window.addEventListener('online', () => this.handleOnline());
    window.addEventListener('offline', () => this.handleOffline());
    this.checkApiAvailability();
  }
  
  async sendMessage(message: string): Promise<string> {
    if (this.isOnline && this.apiAvailable) {
      try {
        return await this.sendToAPI(message);
      } catch (error) {
        console.warn('API call failed, using mock response:', error);
        return this.generateMockResponse(message);
      }
    }
    
    return this.generateMockResponse(message);
  }
  
  private async checkApiAvailability(): Promise<void> {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/health', { 
        method: 'HEAD',
        timeout: 5000 
      });
      this.apiAvailable = response.ok;
    } catch {
      this.apiAvailable = false;
    }
  }
}
```
